## 🎬 Movie Recommender System ##
This project implements a Movie Recommender System using machine learning and data analysis techniques. 
A Jupyter Notebook (movie-recommender-system.ipynb) that walks through building the recommendation engine step by step.
A web application (app.py) that lets you interact with the recommender system locally in your browser.

## Features: ##
* Data loading and preprocessing of movie datasets
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
* Content-based filtering using cosine similarity
* Movie recommendation function to suggest top movies similar to a given title
* Easy-to-use interface within the Jupyter Notebook
* Local web app for user interaction
