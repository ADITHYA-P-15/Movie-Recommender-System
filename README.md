## üé¨ Movie Recommender System ##
This project implements a Movie Recommender System using machine learning and data analysis techniques. 
A Jupyter Notebook (movie-recommender-system.ipynb) that walks through building the recommendation engine step by step.
A web application (app.py) that lets you interact with the recommender system locally in your browser.

## Features: ##
* Data loading and preprocessing of movie datasets
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
* Content-based filtering using cosine similarity
* Movie recommendation function to suggest top movies similar to a given title
* Easy-to-use interface within the Jupyter Notebook
* Local web app for user interaction


## Tech Stack: ##
* Python
* PyCharm 
* Streamlit
* Pandas, NumPy ‚Äì Data processing
* Scikit-learn ‚Äì Machine learning (cosine similarity)
* NLTK ‚Äì Text processing 
* Matplotlib, Seaborn ‚Äì Data visualization

## Working: ##
* The app displays a dropdown list of movies available in the dataset.
* The user selects a movie from the list.
* The system computes similarity using cosine similarity on movie features.
* It recommends a list of top N similar movies (e.g., 5 recommendations).

## Example: ##
* If the user selects ‚ÄúThe Dark Knight‚Äù, the recommender suggests movies like:

* Batman Begins
* The Dark Knight Rises
* Batman
* Man of Steel
* Iron Man
