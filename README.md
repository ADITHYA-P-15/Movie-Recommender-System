ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommender System
This project implements a Movie Recommender System using machine learning and data analysis techniques. The notebook (movie-recommender-system.ipynb) demonstrates how to build a recommendation engine that suggests movies based on user preferences and similarity measures.

## Features: ##
Data loading and preprocessing of movie datasets
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
Content-based filtering using cosine similarity
Movie recommendation function to suggest top movies similar to a given title
Easy-to-use interface in the notebook

## Tech Stack: ##
Python
Pandas, NumPy â€“ Data processing
Scikit-learn â€“ Machine learning (cosine similarity)
NLTK / Text processing libraries 
Matplotlib, Seaborn â€“ Data visualization
